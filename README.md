# The Ultimate Spring Boot Course

This repository contains the starter project for Part 2 of my Spring Boot course:

[https://codewithmosh.com/p/spring-boot-building-apis](https://codewithmosh.com/p/spring-boot-building-apis)

## About this Repository 

This project is based on the final project from Part 1 of the course, but Iâ€™ve cleaned it up and removed unnecessary playground code so we can focus on building APIs in Part 2.

Youâ€™ll be cloning this repository and coding along with me as we extend the project.

To get started, clone the repository to your local machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mosh-hamedani/spring-api-starter

cd spring-api
```
